        <p>on 20th August 2018, fifth meeting was scheduled and started at 11.00 p.m.&nbsp; During the meeting I showed
            the proposed sitemap to them on my laptop using Foxit Reader. Mr. Dinesh Balasooriya &amp; Mr. Chamal
            Rajapaksha observed entire sitemap. After that, they told they were really appreciating the structure and
            the layout of the sitemap that I had created. Also, they told it was a very clear idea of the structure of
            the electronic book.</p>
        <p>Thereby, they told me to finalize the sitemap since they appreciated it, and to proceed to the next stages of
            the multimedia product. After saying that, the next meeting was scheduled to be on the 2nd of September
            2018.</p>
        <p>This meeting will be held at the school main hall including the Mr Steven Jayasingha, head of the Advanced
            Level section of the school told that he would like to see the progress of the multimedia product.</p>
        <p>Meeting 5 was adjourned at 12.30 p.m.</p>
