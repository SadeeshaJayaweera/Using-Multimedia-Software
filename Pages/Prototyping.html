        <p>The Adobe Flash Professional CC 2015 was used to create the prototype of the multimedia product so as the
            reason why I selected that was to make it user-friendly.</p>
        <p>All the other designs were also developed and edited using the Adobe Flash Professional CC 2015 and exported
            them into prototypes. The final product was launched by improving the prototypes. In order to run prototypes
            in a web browser, I exported it into SWF format. Therefore, it can be opened and used on a flash player.</p>
        <p>I installed the latest version of the Adobe Flash player into my computer to present this product to our
            client, Mr. Dinesh Balasooriya. I have tested the product and also collected user feedbacks to make further
            modifications to the product.</p>

        <p>The third meeting was started at 3.00 p.m. on 22nd August 2018 and held in the school main hall. All the
            decisions were taken in the last meeting regarding the designs of the product were briefed by me. After
            that, I presented the prototype to them.</p>
        <p>I also showed the prototype to Mr. Dinesh Balasooriya &amp; Mr. Chamal Rajapaksha with the use of my laptop.
            I guided them through the prototype at first as they watched. Only links that working were the few pages of
            the Notes section, Home and Activities buttons.&nbsp; Each of them went through the prototype on their own
            and gave the suggestions to modify the product.</p>
        <p>The given suggestions were listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Background colour changes to the product</li>
            <li>Add more multimedia components to the product</li>
            <li>Add a few buttons and make few changes to the included multimedia components on the home page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mr. Dinesh Balasooriya and Mr. Chamal Rajapaksha were satisfied with the proposed prototype since it had user
            friendly look. They told me to developed a second prototype with the improvements and present it on upcoming
            week. &nbsp;The next meeting is scheduled to be on 29<sup>th</sup> August 2018 at the same place.</p>

        <p><em>on 29th August 2018, the fourth meeting was held at the school main hall. We commenced the meeting at
                1.05 p.m. because Mr Dinesh Balasooriya came a bit late. The meeting was held to present 2nd after
                further improvements from the 1st one. I showed the enhanced prototype to Mr Dinesh Balasooriya &amp; Mr
                Chamal Rajapaksha pointed out the changes that I had made. The working links at the occasion are
                Question, short note, home button and one page of a short note.</em></p>
        <p><em>Mr Chamal Rajapaksha said that the product was done well and have an attractive look compared to the
                first one, but there are few improvements to be done still. Thereafter he told to add a few images and
                videos to make the product more attractive and interactive. After that Mr Dinesh Balasooriya told
                product colour could be changed to a shade of green since the current colour is very colourful and bit
                hard to work with it for many hours. He satisfied with the few buttons I have added to the product.
                However, he was not fully happy with the layout thereby he gave me a few suggestions to be done to the
                product to make it more effective. </em></p>
        <p><em>However, Mr. Chamal Rajapaksha and Mr. Dinesh Balasooriya were satisfied with the second prototype than
                the first one.</em></p>
        <p><em>They requested me to complete the final product as soon as possible. After that discussion was made about
                the sitemap for the ebook. During the discussion, they told me to present the sitemap within a few days
                to get an idea of how the information would be: separated into subheadings and separate fields and how
                they will be connected.</em></p>
        <p><em>The next meeting was scheduled to be on 2<sup>nd</sup> September 2018 at the same place. Meeting
                No.4&nbsp; Adjourned at&nbsp; 3.00 p.m.</em></p>
