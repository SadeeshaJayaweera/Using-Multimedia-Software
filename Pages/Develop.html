        <p>Now it&rsquo;s the time to produce a fully working multimedia product by refining after completion of the
            second prototype. Also feedbacks, comments and suggestions were taken from the client and taken them into
            account, during this process.&nbsp; We have also conducted a frequent meeting with the members of the
            advanced level section of the Scholl and the Client. Thereby they will be up to date with the progress of
            the multimedia product.</p>
        <p>The development of the multimedia product done by using the Adobe Flash Professional CC 2015.&nbsp; The main
            reason to choose this software because it&rsquo;s very user-friendly and allowed me to add many multimedia
            components into both prototypes and the final product such as images, text, videos, etc. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>The information added to this eBook &ldquo;Your Pal in GIT&rdquo; was taken by many books and also from the
            internet. Most of the content was taken: from the &ldquo;www.apepanthiya.com&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>The questions were taken from many websites such as &ldquo;www.nie.lk.&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;www.guruwaraya.lk&rdquo; and images were downloaded from the google also some were made by me. I used
            Microsoft office 2016 and Adobe Photoshop CC 2015 to edit and create images. The downloaded videos were
            edited using the software called total video converter. The multimedia product was tested once it was
            completed also user feedback was gathered to find issues and improvements needed to be done to the product.
            Thereby we made sure that all the client&rsquo;s requirements were met.</p>
        <p>After user feedback was received, a modified multimedia product was integrated: into DVD disk drive with its
            user guide. The DVD disk drive which contains multimedia product in SWF format and user guide in txt format
            was ready to be delivered to Mr Dinesh Bamunusingha.</p>

            an important note regarding the &ldquo;input devices&rdquo; were misplaced. 9<sup>th</sup> September 2018
            was scheduled to be held the next progress discussion meeting at the same place.</p>

        <p>The 7th meeting started at 5.00 p.m. The reason for this meeting was to see the progress of the product
            ongoing product until today. I showed the ebook in SWF format using a multimedia projector since most parts
            of the product was completed. During the presentation, I requested them to note every mistake in the
            multimedia product. So we can discuss the errors and other problems. Therefore, we can correct them when
            going through the development process of the full product.</p>
        <p>However, there were few errors such as typing mistakes and damaged links. Mr. Dinesh Bamunusingha and Mr
            Chamal Rajapaksha were very happy with the progress of the product since I was able to complete most of the
            parts of the product by this time.</p>
        <p>The next meeting was scheduled to be on 22<sup>nd</sup> september 2018.Meeting adjourned at 6.30 p.m.</p>

        <p>Meeting No. 8 started at 8.00 a.m. in the school main hall. I presented the multimedia product by correcting
            given errors and issues. The main purpose of this meeting was to proofread the entire multimedia product
            from the beginning to the end. 85% of the product was completed and few developments were left such as
            adding videos, image sizing, etc. I displayed the multimedia product to all the members including Mr. Dinesh
            Balasooriya and Mr. Chamal Rajapaksha. Also, I showed the downloaded sample videos so it was very easy for
            them to choose the most relevant one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dinesh Rajapaksha selected two videos out of the shown videos and told to include them on the multimedia
            product because they were very most suitable out of the rest.</p>
        <p>The final product should be presented to test user by completing all the editing works.&nbsp; The next
            meeting was scheduled to be on 2nd October 2018. The meeting adjourned at 10.00 a.m.</p>

            Rajapaksha was satisfied with the progress that we have made over the past few months.</p>
        <p>I listed the rest of the changes that were required for finishing touches for the completion of the
