        <p>The designs for the Multimedia Product were carried out using Adobe Photoshop CC 2015. All the designs are
            exported in JPEG format in order to present them to the clients easily. To present image files via Foxit
            Reader I have exported all the images into PDF file format by using Microsoft Office 2010. Since the Foxit
            reader only work with PDF files.</p>

        <p>The second Meeting was summoned on 17th August 2018 by the client. Mr. Dinesh Balasooriya, Ms. Renuka Perera,
            Mr. Vidura Peiris and Mr. Chamal Rajapaksha proposed more progress on the designs that I added in the
            layout. Furthermore, all of us discussed appropriate and inappropriate ideas of the product and what are the
            things should be added to make students more attractive and interested. They examined both proposals and
            found both of them looks good. After a big comparison, they came to a conclusion to select the 1st proposal
            and to improve it furthermore by giving suggestions to the selected design.</p>
        <p>However, few improvements were suggested to the product from current designs and they were listed below.</p>
        <p>The font style and the colour of the title of the ebook should be different like the proposal 2, rather than
            using the same font style and colour which is used: for short notes and activities headings in the proposal
            1. Answers structure should be like the 2nd proposal but improvement needed.</p>
